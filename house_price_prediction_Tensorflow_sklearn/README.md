# House Price Prediction usinf TensorFlor and Scikit-learn Tools

This project is dedicated to the comprehensive analysis and prediction of house price . Through methodical processes and detailed exploratory data analysis, I aim to derive insights and create robust predictive model by comparing the following models:

1. Lineal Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Neural Network

# Heart Attack Disease Prediction & Analysis

This project is dedicated to the comprehensive analysis and prediction of heart attack diseases. Through methodical processes and detailed exploratory data analysis, I aim to derive insights and create robust predictive models.

## Overview

**Introduction**: 
Initiating the study by examining the significance of the topic, and understanding the dataset variables.

**Data Organization**: 
Essential groundwork, which includes the incorporation of Python libraries, dataset ingestion, and preliminary analysis.

**Data Preparation for EDA**: 
Ensuring data quality through missing value analysis, understanding unique data values, categorizing variables, and obtaining a statistical summary.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
A meticulous exploration phase, where I use univariate and bi-variate analysis. Visualization tools like distplots, pie charts, facet grids, and more provide deeper insights.

**Pre-Modeling Preparations**: 
Optimizing the data for modeling, by handling low-correlation columns, outliers, and skewed data. Various transformations, encodings, and scalings are applied, culminating in the division of data into testing and training sets.

**Modeling**: 
Engaging multiple algorithms to train models, each undergoing rigorous validation and tuning. Models employed include, but are not limited to, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest.

**Conclusion**: 
Reflecting on findings, insights, and results from the extensive analysis and predictive modeling performed.

# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository serves as a central hub for all my machine learning projects. Each project has its own dedicated folder, where you can find more detailed information, code, datasets, and documentation specific to that project.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects available in this repository:

1. [Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/Stef0916/Machine-Learning-projects/tree/main/heart_attack_analysis_prediction/): This project is dedicated to the comprehensive analysis and prediction of heart attack diseases. Through methodical processes and detailed exploratory data analysis, I aim to derive insights and create robust classification predictive models.
2. [House Price Prediction with Tensorflow and sklearn](https://github.com/Stef0916/Machine-Learning-projects/tree/main/house_price_prediction_Tensorflow_sklearn): This project is dedicated to the comprehensive analysis and prediction of house price . Through methodical processes and detailed exploratory data analysis, I aim to derive insights and create robust predictive model by comparing different algorithms.
